# Film Finder

### Description:
The application I created works as a way to help users find movies at a much easier and quicker rate. 
I added a way for users to look up any movie that they want and a way for them to be able to dynamically
change the list of movies within the databank. The users may also play any type of video extension that is
saved unto the physical device on the application.
